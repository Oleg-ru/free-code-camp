    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put butter and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a saucepan and melt. Gradually add the flour and stir so that no lumps remain.</li>
        <li>When all the flour is mixed, pour in all the milk. Turn down the heat and simmer until the desired consistency: not liquid, but not too thick. It is important to constantly stir the sauce so that it does not burn. The consistency of low-fat sour cream.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Add minced meat (preferably pork + veal).</li>
        <li>Roast the minced meat until it is half cooked. Pour the bolognese sauce into it, add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees. Grease the mold with butter. Pour a little bechamel sauce on the bottom, just a little, just to cover the bottom.</li>
        <li>Lay out the layers (not boiled). Put the resulting minced meat on the layers (we do not regret it!), grated cheese on the minced meat. The cheese has bechamel sauce.</li>
        <li>Add as much sauce as you think is necessary to make the lasagna juicy. Place the dry lasagna sheets on top of the sauce. Repeat the procedure.</li>
        <li>Spread the last layer of sheets with bechamel sauce and sprinkle cheese generously on top. Let stand for 7-10 minutes. Put it in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes.</li>
